# Ableton Live Racks, Presets, Devices, etc
Just my personal utilities, notes, tools, etc. Work in progress.
All compiled by me unless otherwise stated. I've tried to include links to original creator/conceptualist where possible.

<br>

**Chord Device Presets**
- Presets for Ableton's Chord device for nearly every chord (within reason)
- Organized by Root Position, 1st, 2nd, 3rd inversions, and a folder with all voicings
- I'm not that knowledgeable of advanced music theory so let me know if there's any mistakes
<br>

**Native Trackspacer / Dynamic EQ**<br>
All credit to [Taka Perry](https://takaperry.gumroad.com/) for the [original Spacesaver rack (via Gumroad)](https://takaperry.gumroad.com/l/qxuqw). I've simply made some minor adjustments.
- Uses only stock devices
- 16 bands, adjustable Amount, Q, Tilt, Scale (100% to inverted), Attack, Release, Low Cut, High Cut
- Band frequencies can be adjusted by hand, ie. selecting the bands and moving them in the graphical display
- Usage: put the rack on the track you want to get dipped, in the Routing chain, select your sidechain track in the "Audio From" drop-down
