## Ableton Live Racks, Presets, Devices, etc.
Just my personal utilities. Work in progress â€“ Descriptions & usage to come.
<br>
<br>

- **Chord Device Presets**
  - Presets for Ableton's Chord device for nearly every chord (within reason)
  - Organized by Root Position, 1st, 2nd, 3rd inversions, and a folder with all voicings
  - I'm not that knowledgeable of advanced music theory so let me know if there's any mistakes
<br>

- **Native Trackspacer / Dynamic EQ**
(I'm really sorry for not giving credit to whoever built the original version of this. I've edited yours to suit my process but I have no idea where I found it originally.) 
  - Kind of a poor-person's Trackspacer, built with only stock devices
  - 16 bands, adjustable Amount, Q, Tilt, Scale (100% to inverted), Attack, Release, Low Cut, High Cut
  - Band frequencies can be adjusted by hand, ie. selecting the bands and moving them in the graphical display
  - Usage: put the rack on the track you want to get dipped, in the Routing chain, select your sidechain track in the "Audio From" drop-down
