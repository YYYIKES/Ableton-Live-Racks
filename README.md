# Ableton Live Racks, Presets, Devices, etc
Just my personal utilities. Work in progress.
<br>
<br>

**Chord Device Presets**
- Presets for Ableton's Chord device for nearly every chord (within reason)
- Organized by Root Position, 1st, 2nd, 3rd inversions, and a folder with all voicings
- I'm not that knowledgeable of advanced music theory so let me know if there's any mistakes
<br>

**Native Trackspacer / Dynamic EQ**<br>
All credit to [Taka Perry](https://takaperry.gumroad.com/) for the [original Spacesaver rack (via Gumroad)](https://takaperry.gumroad.com/l/qxuqw). I've simply made some minor adjustments.
- Uses only stock devices
- 16 bands, adjustable Amount, Q, Tilt, Scale (100% to inverted), Attack, Release, Low Cut, High Cut
- Band frequencies can be adjusted by hand, ie. selecting the bands and moving them in the graphical display
- Usage: put the rack on the track you want to get dipped, in the Routing chain, select your sidechain track in the "Audio From" drop-down

...descriptions and usage notes to come.
